			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>Antonino is a passionate and ambitious student who always knew he wanted to pursue a career in technology. When he heard about the front-end development bootcamp offered by the University of Birmingham, he knew it was the perfect opportunity to take him skills to the next level.

        As soon as Antonino started the bootcamp, he was thrilled to find that it was everything he had hoped for and more. The instructors were knowledgeable and supportive, and the curriculum was comprehensive and challenging. I love diving into topics like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and responsive design, and I was always eager to learn more. </p>
