**My personal portfolio challenge week 2**

This is the challenge of week 2 of the BootCamp from University of Birmingham

**User Story**

In this challenge I wanted to have an online portfolio with personal information and details of the projects I will make in the future which will be a great opportunity to showcase to potential employers.

**Technology**

This project was developed using only HTML and CSS files - with the addition of the README file.

**Acceptance Criteria**

This challenge was an opportunity to put in action what we have been discussed in the past 2 weeks. Moreover, I found it quite difficul to develop a portfolio which reflects 100% what the challenge was requesting. So, I have opted to work with something simpler and throughout the weeks and alongside the new knowledge that I will build and empower I will keep amending and carry on working on this portfolio to make sure by the end of the bootcamp it will be looking like a professional front-end developer. 

I have worked with a basic white background, adding a nav bar with my name on the left side and some buttons (which in the future will be linking to the actual sections of the portfolio) - The body of the page is made by 4 sections:
- Hero image
- About me 
- Portfolio
- Contact

The hero image section is a very simple image which divide the nav bar from the content with a welcome message in the center.
The about me section is giving a short paragraph about myself. 
The portfolio section should represent the work I will be creating in the upcoming weeks. Also, I have added a very simple CSS hover style making these images go lighter when the user go over them. 
The contact section, includes my contact details in a row list.

Then a simple footer at the bottom of the page.
